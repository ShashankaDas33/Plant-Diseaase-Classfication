# Plant-Diseaase-Classfication
🌿 Plant Disease Classification using Deep Learning
This project focuses on the automatic classification of plant diseases using deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained to identify and categorize various plant diseases from leaf images with high accuracy.

🔍 Objective
To develop a reliable and efficient system for detecting plant diseases at an early stage, helping farmers and agricultural experts take timely actions to improve crop yield and reduce losses.

🚀 Features
Image classification using pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or custom CNN).

Support for multiple plant species and disease types.

User-friendly interface for uploading leaf images and getting instant predictions.

Visualizations of training metrics and confusion matrix.

Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for improved performance.

🗂 Dataset
The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which includes over 50,000 labeled images across multiple classes of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy & Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Streamlit (for optional web app demo)

📈 Model Performance
Achieved over 95% accuracy on the validation set, with strong generalization across unseen data.
